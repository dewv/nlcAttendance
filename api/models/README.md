This folder is for [models](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/concepts/models-and-orm/models).

Each model in the application will have its own file here.

In general, the files should contain only the definition of the model's [attributes](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/concepts/models-and-orm/attributes) and [associations](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/concepts/models-and-orm/associations).
