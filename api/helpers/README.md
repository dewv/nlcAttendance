This folder is for [helpers](https://sailsjs.com/documentation/concepts/helpers).

Helpers are reusable code routines, stored in files with "kebab-case" names. 

The syntax for using a helper is: `sails.helpers.helperName()`. Here `helperName` represents the "kebab-case" filename converted to (lower) "camelCase". The naming conventions are explained [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case#Special_case_styles).
